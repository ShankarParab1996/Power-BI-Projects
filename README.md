# ADVENTURE WORK SALES ANALYTICS  

I led a comprehensive Adventure Work Sales project using Microsoft Power BI, showcasing a diverse set of skills. Beginning with meticulous data preparation, validation, and transformation, I ensured the integrity and reliability of the dataset. The subsequent data modeling facilitated a robust foundation for insights.

●	 Creating three distinct dashboards for executive, product, and customer perspectives, I utilized advanced features such as drill-through, bookmarking, and grouping, enhancing the user's ability to delve into specific areas of interest. The implementation of Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) allowed for the creation of meaningful measures, powering key performance indicators and analytical insights.

●	I established solid relationships between fact and data tables, ensuring a seamless flow of information and accuracy in reporting. The Power BI Desktop served as a dynamic canvas, where I leveraged various visualization tools including KPI cards, slicers, graphs, tables, matrices, and maps to present a holistic view of sales data.

●	In addition, I crafted an intuitive navigation panel, simplifying the exploration across the three dashboards. This project not only demonstrated my proficiency in Power BI but also showcased my ability to seamlessly navigate through data preparation, modeling, and visualization, resulting in a powerful tool for executive decision-making and strategic insights.
